# Single page app â€” user creates a new note

- The user creates a new note and submits it
- By clicking on Submit the JS script prevents the default action of the `onsubmit` event handler
- It then creates a new note with the content from the `<input>` element
- This new note is pushed at the end of the local copy of the `notes` array
- Then the `<input>` element is cleared
- The new note is displayed on the page
- Then the new note is also sent to the server in the body of the POST request to the URL `https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa`
- The server adds it to the `notes` array and responds with a `201` status code and an object `{"message":"note created"}`
